<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>
        CBS Gaming is composed of a handful of students like yourself working to bring videogames in different shapes and forms to CBS.<br>
        We want to see students embrace gaming as a serious industry as well as a playful entertainment platform.<br>
        The organization was founded in September 2015 with the same goal.
</p>
 

<h3>What We Do</h3>

<p>
        To reach our goal, we organize tournaments with popular games such as FIFA and Counter Strike.<br>
        We do LAN-parties and tournaments for the gamers who play the newest games.<br>
        For business and networking we visit companies or do product testing of unreleased gaming peripherals!
</p>
