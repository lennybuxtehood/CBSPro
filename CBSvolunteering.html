<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>
        We are a group of CBS Students that actively promote local volunteering for good causes and want to make it as easy<br> 
        as possible for CBS students to find and join volunteer work opportunities in their local communities.
</p>
 

<h3>What We Do</h3>

<p>
        We organize volunteering opportunities for CBS students and cooperate with many different local NGOs and non-profits.<br>
        We also organize public events with non-profit organizations to broaden CBS studentsâ€™ sense for community and actively support the non-profit organizations we cooperate with.
</p>
