<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p> We like to think of ourselves as an open, inclusive community, where letting go of control is our core value.<br> 
    We foster and encourage awkward and spontaneous moments in a creative and liberating environment. <br>
    We aim for everyone to leave our workshops feeling uplifted, energised, and special. 
</p>
 

<h3>What We Do</h3>

<p>We meet once a week on Thursdays at 17:30 n the Dalgas Have Building on the CBS Campus.<br> 
    We will meet in the CBS Move studio in the basement. We usually have an intro level workshop until 19:00 <br>
    and then a more advanced one until 20:30 - but people of all backgrounds and experiences are welcome! 
</p>

<h3>What is Improv</h3>

<p>Improv is a form of theatre in which all elements of a scene or story are made up in the moment. <br>
    In our workshops, we coach people to get out of their comfort zone, stay in the moment, <br>
    listen and react genuinely, and most importantly, re-learn to say "yes".
 </p>
